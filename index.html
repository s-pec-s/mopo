Could I be man enough to be your friend<BR>
Can I handle loosing you again<BR>

I got it now that bridge was burned<BR>
I screwed up and the lessons learned <BR>
I know what to do never atoll<BR>
That to get back up first I gotta crawl<BR>
Staring at with the ash of days past<BR>
I put that collection together call it burnt edges<BR>

Written in the pages of history<BR>
You moved on and sitting here is me<BR>
